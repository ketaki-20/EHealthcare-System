The E-Health Care Management System is a comprehensive platform designed to streamline
the management of healthcare services. It offers three primary interfaces: a patient interface
for users to book appointments, an admin interface for healthcare professionals to manage
patient records, doctor schedules, and medical data, and a doctor interface to view and
comment on appointments. Admins can manage doctor availability, and ensure that medical
data is securely handled. The application includes secure login features for all three interfaces.
Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, JSP and JDBC the system provides a
user-friendly and efficient way for users to access healthcare services online.
